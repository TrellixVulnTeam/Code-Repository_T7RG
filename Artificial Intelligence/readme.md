The project is intended to get an understanding of the 

- Generative Adversarial Network
- Using GAN for Synthetic Data generation
- Understanding the Influence of Synthetic Data on Model Performance

Intention : 

- Read the MNIST dataset
- Create two classes. 5 and NOT 5
- Balance the classes using stratified sampling
    - Lot of data will be discarded in the process
- Train a Neural network model and check its performance
- Create a GAN and train it with MNIST data
- Generate Synthetic data of MNIST using GAN
- Train the model from scratch, this time with more data produced by GAN
- Compare the performance
