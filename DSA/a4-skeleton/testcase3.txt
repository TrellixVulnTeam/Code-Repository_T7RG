Test case 3:

Procedure is same as previous test case except that we test this only on
directories :

let us choose the same directory we choose for test case 2:

ls -di kernel-0/arch

2415723 kernel-0/arch

use that file id :

tree = convert_input_to_tree(filename): # already tested in test case 1
d=mydir(2415723)
print(f' total files in dir: {d.dir_total_files(tree)}')

It should print:  5581.

You can verify this by doing the following on linux terminal:

cd kernel-0/arch

find . -type f | wc -l

this should print 5581. 

Please do not modify anything in the kernel-0 folder after extraction.
