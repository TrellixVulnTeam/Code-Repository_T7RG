1. extract the a4-skeleton.tar file.
2. in the same directory extract the kernel-0.zip OR kernel-0.tar.bz2 file.
  -- unzip for zip file
  -- tar xvf for tar file

3. do a "ls" and verify you have the following files :

filetree.py
kernel-0.files #input file for your test cases
testcase1.txt
testcase2.txt
testcase3.txt
README 
test1.py
test2.py
test3.py
tree_traverse_test

Read the instructions for running test cases. You have to modify test2.py and
test3.py on your system. See instructions in the corresponding .txt files.

USE your mylist.py that you have done for quiz4. If it has passed all test cases
in codepost, it should work.

and after the extraction in step2 above :
you will see a directory "kernel-0" under which all files will be there.
Do not tamper with this directory.

Have fun !!
