Test Case 2:
************

Take any one file randomly from the kernel-0.files (both file or directory
should be okay for this test)

eg., pick a file: 

kernel-0/arch/m32r/boot/compressed/install.sh

Do the following cmd from the directory where kernel-0 folder is in: 

ls -di kernel-0/arch/m32r/boot/compressed/install.sh

sample output on my system given below:

2417846 kernel-0/arch/m32r/boot/compressed/install.sh

the left most number above is the "objectid", fileid or inode number from stat.
This should differ on your system and is unique across all files in the
filesystem.


With that number you are now ready to write second test case:


tree = convert_input_to_tree(filename): # already tested in test case 1
d=myfile(2417846)
print(d.file_path(tree))

the above should print : kernel-0/arch/m32r/boot/compressed/install.sh


Now pick a directory from the kernel-0.files file.

kernel-0/arch/m32r/boot/compressed

follow the same procedure as above to get the fileid. on my system :

ls -di kernel-0/arch/m32r/boot/compressed/

gives 

2417841 kernel-0/arch/m32r/boot/compressed/

take the left most number on your system and you are ready to write the same
test case but for the directory now and ensure it works :


tree = convert_input_to_tree(filename): # already tested in test case 1
d=mydir(2417841) 
print(d.file_path(tree))

the above should print : kernel-0/arch/m32r/boot/compressed/

if you passed this congrats ! now go to test case 3.
