 ## The project deals with using the Models from Google for preditions
---

- The models are extracted from the Github repository https://github.com/tensorflow/models
- Although RCNN is used in this case, any models can be extracted and used in the same way.
- The available models are https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md

Note : RCNN are really slow in prediction and hence the same cannot be used for any tasks which requires faster prediction.
