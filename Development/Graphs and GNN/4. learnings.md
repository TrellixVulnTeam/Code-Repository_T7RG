# Learnings

- Understood basics of Neo4j
- Installed AppImage of Desktop version
- Experimented with basic commands in Movie toy dataset in AuraDB
- Checked basic cypher commands
- Uploaded the lat_long.csv ,dataset in Neo4j using LOAD CSV command
- torch_geomoetric.data modules contains a data class that allows to create graphs from data by specifiying
	- attributes with each node
	- connectivity/adjacency of each node
- To create a graph in pytorch, we need the node feature matrix , node.x and node.edge_index
- node.x has the information that is inside a node
- node_edge_index has information about how nodes are connected with one another. 

Possible next steps : 

- In the given examples, we might have to get this information and create the graph using torch_geometric.data
- Then run the classification approach to classify the nodes into different clusters.
